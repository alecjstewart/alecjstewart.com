                        I do love my parents very much, but boy, does it get annoying when they continually tell me what I should do and how I should handle things. They’re probably right about most of the things they’re saying but let me learn and make my own mistakes!

            Listen because you respect the intellectual integrity they bring to their questions.

            You learn more from people who challenge your thought process than from those who affirm your conclusions.

            That doesn't mean drive through without stopping because you think your light would be green.

                        I found the clock and set it up. As I finished setting it up, I realized how thoughtful that gift was and still is. It was an inexpensive gift relatively speaking, but one that has been the most practical and useful.

            Thoughtfulness is worth more than any number that can be punched on to a price tag, and simple, inexpensive things can be the most practical and most worthwhile.

                        Luckily I had a backup alarm that woke me up, so I wasn't that late. The whole situation got me thinking about how to rely on my phone less but still have an alarm to wake up to. I remembered that someone gave me a $20 digital clock as a high school graduation present.

                        This morning, I got up late for physical training. I usually set the alarm on my phone but I've been trying to move away from relying on that device for everything. I set the alarm on my wristwatch instead, but I didn't hear it or turned it off when it was beeping.

                        Today, my desktop calendar quote of the day was, "If you could eliminate all stress from your life, would you wish to do so?"

            I'd have to say that I wouldn't.

            Stress can tear you apart, yes, but it ultimately builds you up. Listen to it and you'll grow, develop, and learn.
